Notice them.</li><li>What consumes your mind, controls your life.</li><li>You are what you do, not what you say you do.</li><li>You gotta stop watering dead plants.</li><li>Sometimes you don't realize you are actually drowning when you are trying to be everyone else's anchor.</li><li>The answers you seek never come when the mind is busy. They come when the mind is still.</li><li>Dreams don't work unless you do.</li><li>You are always one decision away from a totally different life.</li><li><blockquote><q>Beginnings are usually scary and endings are usually sad, but it's everything in between that makes it all worth.</q><footer>Bob Marley</footer></blockquote></li><li>If they want you in their life, they will put you there. You shouldn' have to fight for a spot.</li><li>Don't fell guilty for doing what is best for you.</li><li>Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness.</li><li>Whoever is trying to bring you down, is already below you.</li><li>Never explain yourself to anyone. You don't need anyone's approval. Live your life and do what makes you happy.</li><li>When you feel like quitting, think about why you started.</li><li>Over time, you will start to notice, that some people just aren't worth it anymore.</li><li>Overthinking kills your happiness.</li><li>Don't rush things that need time to grow.</li></ol></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12"><hr><footer><p class="text-center">2016 by Tom Lutzenberger<br><a href="https://github.com/tomlutzenberger/life-advices" title="Contribute on GitHub" target="_blank">Contribute on GitHub</a></p></footer></div></div></div></body></html>
